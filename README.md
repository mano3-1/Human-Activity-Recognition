# Human-Activity-Recognition
Classifying human activities from pose by posenet model

##Main aim:
The main aim of this repository is to classify few human activities based on the pose generated by posnet model.

##requirements:
1)Keras 2.0
2)opencv-python

##About posenet:
Posenet, a deep learning model has shown state of art results in recognising pose.
It detects 17 keypoints to generate the human pose.

##Data:
The data which I used in this repository was generated from UCF101_data(Link is provided below) by running through the posenet model.I have taken 20 frames per example and then ran it through the posenet model and obtained the heatmaps.So the data used is of shape (m,20,16,17,21)
