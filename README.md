# Human-Activity-Recognition
Classifying human activities from pose by posenet model

## Main aim:
The main aim of this repository is to classify few human activities based on the pose generated by posnet model.

## Requirements:
1)Keras 2.0<br/>
2)opencv-python

## About posenet:
Posenet, a deep learning model has shown state of art results in recognising pose.
It detects 17 keypoints of human body to estimate the human pose.

## Data:
The data which I used in this repository was generated from UCF101_data(Link is provided below) by running through the posenet model.I have taken 20 frames per datapoint and then ran it through the posenet model and obtained the heatmaps.So the data used is of shape (m,20,16,17,21) where m is the training examples you are going to extract from UCF101 dataset ,20 is the number of frmaes we are considering to create the dataset and (16 ,17 ,21) is the shape of heatmap.<br/>

## Main Idea:
The main idea is to train a model of few convlstm2d layers.The model was trained on focal loss to deal with class imbalance.Dropouts are also used to get rid of overfitting(as the model has high number of parameters ,there is a high chance of overfitting!).

## Training:
The training was done in google colab(with GPU accelerator).And it took aroung 8hrs to fully get trained.All the learning curves are shown below.
